HTML5 Canvas Space Invaders

- Created player with imported image, added key down movement, created slight rotation to embellish on movement.
- Enemies spawn in random sized grids, move in classic pattern across the screen back and forth, and fire projectiles.
- Enemies and projectile sprites are removed with collision detection.
- Garbage removal removes stray projectiles to keep high performance and avoid unnecessary computation.
- Used Canvas to draw the background and projectiles
- Created a Game-Over UI

Was fun making this classic game. Hope you guys enjoy!
